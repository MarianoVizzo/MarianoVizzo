- 👋 Hi, I’m Mariano.
- 👀 I’m interested for technology and for using data to generate insights that allow us to strategically optimize and enhance key areas of organizations.
- 🌱 As I’m a lifelong learner, I’m studying two postgraduate degrees: a Master's Degree in Financial Data Management and Analysis, and a Specialization in Quantitative Methods for Data Management and Analysis in Organizations at the University of Buenos Aires.
- 🔎 At this moment, my goal is to find a professional opportunity or be part of projects that allow me to put my skills and knowledge in Data Analysis into practice, contributing to the achievement of defined objectives.
- 📫 If you want to contact me, you can write to me directly on mail mariano_vizzo@hotmail.com / marianovizzo@gmail.com
